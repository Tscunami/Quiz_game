- https://repl.it/join/ryngbtmv-luknplava

Description:
- Quiz Game, where player answer True/False on given questions
- Whole game is created in OOP
- If you want try this game with different questions, I recommend this website: https://opentdb.com/ , to download new date
  - Simply go to API, choose which types of questions you want (True/False) 
  - Generate link, open this URL and copy given text to data.py in question_data
  - In main.py change 
        question = Question(item['question'], item['correct_answer']) 
      so the index: question and correct_answer are replaced with key words from data.py

Enjoy :)
